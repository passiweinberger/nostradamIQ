Earthquake Resources


On our Map you can see layers showing recent earthquakes, a "ShakeMap" (by <a href="http://www.pdc.org/solutions/tools/global-hazards-atlas/" target="_blank">PDC</a>, <a href="http://atlas.pdc.org/atlas/" target="_blank">take me to their ATLAS!</a>) models estimated ground motion and shaking intensity following significant earthquakes. You can also use the Global Hazards Atlas to review significant historical earthquakes, tectonic plate boundaries, and more. 

Related Hazards

    Ground shaking and ground displacement
    Landslides and debris falls
    Fire from broken gas or power lines
    Flooding from ruptured dams or levees
    Tsunami (generated by undersea earthquakes)


Precautions

    Have an evacuation plan and <a href="http://nostradamiq.org/landing/Resources/DisasterSupplyKit.html" target="_blank">disaster supply kit</a> ready, including a radio and batteries, goggles and disposable breathing masks.
    Have a <a href="http://nostradamiq.org/landing/Resources/FamilyAwarenessPlan.html" target="_blank">family communication and meeting plan prepared</a>.
    Know how to turn off water and gas supplies to your home.
    Inspect your home for potential earthquake hazards; secure top-heavy furniture to the wall and place heaviest objects on bottom shelves.
     

What to Do During an Earthquake

    If you are inside, seek shelter under a sturdy desk or table and hold on. Stay away from windows and glass fixtures. Remain inside until the shaking stops.
    Do not use elevators.
    If you are outside, stay away from power lines and objects that can fall, such as streetlights, buildings, and trees.
    If you are in a vehicle, pull off the road but do not stop on or under bridges, overpasses, or tunnels.

Q&A: Can Earthquakes Be Predicted?
Although some major earthquakes are preceded by foreshocks, there is currently no reliable method to accurately predict the time, location, and magnitude of a quake. However, the United Nations Environmental Programme/Global Resource Information Database provides information on global earthquake probability and intensity. <a href="http://atlas.pdc.org/atlas/?id=6625" target="_blank">View earthquake intensity zones by ATLAS.PDC</a>. Additionally, we at nostradamIQ are working on a evaluation method for time-dependent liklihoods! <a href="http://nostradamiq.org/landing/index.html#help" target="_blank">Help us!</a>
