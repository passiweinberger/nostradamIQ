Volcanoes Resources

Volcanos are considered active if they are currently erupting or have erupted within the last 10,000 years. A dormant volcano is not currently erupting but is expected to erupt again in the future. An extinct volcano has not erupted within the past 10,000 years and is not expected to erupt again in the near geologic future.

Related Hazards

    Pyroclastic flows (avalanches of hot ash, rock, and gas)
    Lava flows (molten rock)
    Lahars (mudflows)
    Tephra (solid material blown into the atmosphere, large rock fragments and “volcanic bombs”)
    Hazardous gases, such as sulfur dioxide


Precautions

    Have an evacuation plan and <a href="http://nostradamiq.org/landing/Resources/DisasterSupplyKit.html" target="_blank">disaster supply kit</a> ready, including a radio and batteries, goggles and disposable breathing masks.
    Have a <a href="http://nostradamiq.org/landing/Resources/FamilyAwarenessPlan.html" target="_blank">family communication and meeting plan prepared</a>.


What to Do When an Eruption Occurs

    Wear a dust mask or wet handkerchief to filter out ash.
    Close all building windows and doors to keep ash out.
    Follow evacuation orders and leave the area immediately to avoid flying debris, gases, and lava flows.
    Do not cross streams or bridges if a mudflow is approaching. Look upstream.
    Seek higher ground, as mud and debris will accumulate in low-lying areas.

Q&A:
Waht about Hawaii’s Volcanoes?
A slow-moving lava flow from Hawaii’s shield volcanoes can appear deceptively innocuous, but easily destroys everything in its path. When lava enters the ocean, sea water explodes with steam and boiling water. Methane gas explosions can occur, and benches (new land formed from cooling lava) can collapse without warning. Be aware of these dangers when visiting Hawaii’s volcanoes.
